  "description": "# Wildlife Biodiversity Indicator\n\nThis indicator has been developed to be a powerful, impacting, visual indicator to help build the general public’s knowledge and raise awareness around the current status of biodiversity and the importance of conservation efforts. The indicator will build on crowdsourced fauna and flora observation data available from the GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility). In addition to observation data on species, it is possible to retrieve their occurrences and evolution of population over time. Coupling this crowdsourced data with the IUCN red list of endangered species as well as the monitoring of the target habitats’ health allows to build a clear message and narrative to raise the general public’s awareness towards this essential topic.\n\nIn the Analysis panel it is possible to explore correlation of the underlying datasets by allowing filtering of the indicator based on the underlying data.\n\nFollowing filters are available:\n\n- **Vegetation health indicator**: 1 being the areas in the worst health and 5 the areas in the best health in 2023 compared to long term trends\n- **Road pressure indicator**:  fragmentation of natural habitats due to roads by calculating and comparing connectivity areas bordered only by coastlines and those interrupted by roads. The results quantify the pressure exerted by road networks on natural spaces, helping to identify areas under high road pressure. Where 1 is an area with very high road pressure, the difference between the connectivity of the area with and without roads is great, and 5 is an area with very little road pressure.\n- **Categorized species density**: Categorization into five equal groups based on the adjusted and normalized 'species_count_bounds', offering a stratified understanding of biodiversity distribution.\n- **Biodiversity indicator**:  aggregation of data on the number of species present in the area, vegetation quality and spatial connectivity.\n  \nMore information can be found [here](https://github.com/sistemagmbh/IDEAS-IDEAS-Libraries/blob/main/indicator2/Storytelling_Wildlife_biodivesrity.md)\n\n- **Spatial coverage:** Europe\n- **Temporal coverage:** 10 years (2013 – 2022)\n- **Spatial resolution:** 10km\n- **Format:** COG product\n\nV3 - 2024/04/17",
